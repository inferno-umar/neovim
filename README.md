# neovim

This is my personal neovim configuration.

Humble and lightweight on resources.

# Installation

1. Download and install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (a plugin manager for vim/neovim). Don't worry its easy.

2. move the file init.vim to /.../.config/nvim and run this normal command inside nvim :PlugInstall (Make sure you're connected to internet).

3. After installation move coc-settings.json file to /.../.config/nvim.

4. Restart nvim.

And You're done. Enjoy

# Note
You can make changes to the various keybindings in init.vim file.

Autocomplete engine i.e. con-nvim won't work on startup, you can change the line 62 in init.vim to auto-enable it on startup or ;c keybinding to start it manually.

Any suggestion would be appreciated.


Still have any issues raise one. I'll fix it.
