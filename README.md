# Neovim config file

This is my personal Neovim configuration.

Humble and lightweight on resources.

# Requirements

Neovim nightly https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly

GPU terminal emulator

# Installation

Use alacarte to link it to the required directory (For linux only)

1. Download the zip file extract it and place it in the ~/.config/nvim directory.

2. Make a directory plugged in nvim directory

3. Restart neovim.

And You're done. Enjoy
