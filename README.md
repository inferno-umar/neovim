# neovim

This is my personal neovim configuration.

# Installation

move the file init.vim to /.../.config/nvim and restart neovim, rest it will do (Make sure you're connected to internet).
After installation move coc-settings.json file to /.../.config/nvim.

And You're done. Enjoy

# Note
You can make changes to the various keybindings in init.vim file.

Any suggestion would be appreciated.
